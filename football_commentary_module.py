"""
Football Match Commentary Engine
================================

This module provides a sophisticated text-based commentary system for a football
game simulation. It is designed to generate dynamic and context-aware commentary
for various in-game events, from simple passes to dramatic goals.

The system uses a hierarchical and modular approach, with a core engine that
orchestrates different sub-systems for event detection, phrase generation, and
commentator personality. It supports a wide range of football scenarios and
can be easily extended with new events and commentary styles.

This module is a crucial component of our main football game project, providing
a rich and immersive user experience.
