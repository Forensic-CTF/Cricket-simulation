SportsSim Games

Welcome to SportsSim Games! This repository contains the raw source code for two sports simulation games: Cricket Simulator and Football Simulator. Both projects are designed as learning projects and demonstration of game mechanics in C++.

Contents

Cricket Simulator

Simulates a cricket match between two teams.

Features overs, player statistics, ball-by-ball commentary, and match results.

Includes detailed simulation of batting, bowling, and fielding events.

Football Simulator

Simulates football matches between two teams.

Includes match commentary, player actions (goals, passes, fouls), and scoring.

Supports basic team strategies and match flow control.

Features

Realistic match commentary and updates for both sports.

Player statistics tracking (runs, balls, goals, assists, etc.).

Simulation of key match events (boundaries, wickets, goals, tackles).

Randomized events to add variability and replayability.

Written in C++ using standard libraries; no external dependencies required.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SportsSim-Games.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd SportsSim-Games


Compile the desired game:

g++ cricket_simulator.cpp -o cricket_sim
g++ football_simulator.cpp -o football_sim


Run the game:

./cricket_sim
./football_sim

Usage

Cricket Simulator:

Provides ball-by-ball commentary.

Shows player statistics after each innings.

Declares match winner or draw.

Football Simulator:

Displays game commentary in real-time.

Tracks team scores and player actions.

Prints final match summary.

Notes

The code is primarily educational and intended for practice in game simulation and C++ programming.

The code includes multiple functions, loops, and verbose commentary for demonstration purposes.

No external libraries are required; all code is standard C++.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome for improvements, bug fixes, or additional sports simulations.

Please submit pull requests or open issues for discussion.
